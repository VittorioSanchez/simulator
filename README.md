# simulator
This repo is used to share the necessary tools to use the LGSVL simulator. We provided files allowing the creation of object such as the car or the sensors. We also added files allowing the communication via ROS with the outer world as well as python scripts allowing the dynamic acquisition of values for the sensors.

In each subfiles you will find a README providing more instruction and thus being on the use of ROS or LGSVL as well as tutorials to complete installation and prerequisite of each components we used for the Simulator.
